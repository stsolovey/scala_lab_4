During his term of office, Nishani was focused on the European integration process of the country and global challenges affecting Albania such as the immigrant crisis or combating Islamic extremism and radicalization. He was elected in 2012, which commemorated the 100th anniversary of establishing independent Albania and it was a yearlong celebration. During his first months in office his agenda focused on meetings with the Albanian community in the Balkans and the Albanian diaspora to commemorate the 100th anniversary, and to honor and respect all those who fought and sacrificed for the rights existence of the modern Albanian state. His first state visit abroad was in Kosovo, to show that Albania stays committed to help in the process of international recognition of the independence of Kosovo. During his last addressing to the United Nations on September 2016 at the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly he stated that, Albania would address these global challenges in close cooperation with other actors. Its actions would include increasing humanitarian aid, ratifying the Paris Agreement on climate change and implementing all commitments in the security realm.[5] During most state visits abroad, Nishani's policy was maximally oriented towards strengthening good-neighborly relations, citing its support for Kosovo\u2019s participation in all multilateral regional and international activities.[6]","country":"Albania"}
