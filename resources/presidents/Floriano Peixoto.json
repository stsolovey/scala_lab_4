Peixoto was an army marshal when elected vice-president in February 1891. In November 1891, he rose to the presidency after the resignation of Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, the first president of Brazil. Peixoto came to the presidency in a difficult period of the new Brazilian Republic, which was in the midst of a general political and economic crisis made worse by the effects of the bursting of the Encilhamento economic bubble. As Vice President, he had also served as the President of the Senate.[3] His government was marked by several revolutions. Ruling in an authoritarian fashion, Peixoto defeated a naval officers' rebellion against him in 1893\u20131894 and the Federalist Revolution in the States of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, where he ordered many murders and summary executions, during the same years.[4] His government was marked by an increased centralization of power and nationalism, with the florianista cult of personality being the first phenomenon of a favorable political expression towards a republican politician in Brazil.[5] He is often referred to as \"the Consolidator of the Republic\" or \"The Iron Marshal.\" He left the presidency on 15 November 1894. In spite of his unpopularity, he was responsible for the consolidation of the First Brazilian Republic. Desterro, the capital of the state of Santa Catarina, was renamed Florianópolis after its defeat by loyalist troops at the end of the Federalist Revolution.
