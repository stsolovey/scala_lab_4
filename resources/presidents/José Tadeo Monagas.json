In 1846, to head off the challenge from the Liberal Party, ex-President and kingmaker José Antonio Páez selected Monagas as Conservative candidate. Páez thought Monagas could be controlled but he gravitated toward the Liberals, and eventually dispersed the Congress. In 1848 Páez led a rebellion against Monagas but was defeated by General Santiago Mariño in the 'Battle of the Araguatos', imprisoned, and eventually exiled.[1] As a member of the Liberal Party, he abolished capital punishment for political crimes. The Liberal Party also passed laws that abolished slavery, extended suffrage, and limited interest rates. José Tadeo Monagas also supported his brother José Gregorio for the presidency. José Tadeo Monagas and his brother José Gregorio Monagas combined rule 1847\u20131858 is commonly referred to as the Monagas Dynasty or \"Monagato\". During José Tadeo's second term, the Monagas brothers attempted to end term limits and extend presidential terms to six-years, which instead ended with the overthrow of José Tadeo at the hands of Julián Castro and his Liberal and Conservative allies. Monagas was married to Luisa Oriach Ladrón de Guevara, who served as First Lady of Venezuela from 1847 until 1851. She was then First Lady again from 1855 until 1858.[citation needed] Luisa Oriach Ladrón de Guevara","country":"Venezuela"}
