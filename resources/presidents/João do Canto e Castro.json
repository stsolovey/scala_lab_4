He also briefly served as 67th Prime Minister of Portugal.[1] He was the son of General José Ricardo da Costa da Silva Antunes (Lisbon, 7 February 1831 \u2013 7 August 1906) and wife (m. 1860) Maria da Conceição do Canto e Castro Mascarenhas Valdez (24 October 1825 \u2013 Lisbon, 20 April 1892). In 1891 he married Mariana de Santo António Moreira Freire Correia Manoel Torres de Aboim (Lisbon, 13 June 1865 \u2013 18 January 1946), sister of the 1st Viscount da Idanha and niece of the 1st Viscount de Vila Boim, and had issue. He occupied the post of Navy Minister, to which he had been appointed by Sidónio Pais, the \"President-King\" on 9 September 1918, and succeeded Pais after his murder on 14 December 1918. During his rule there were two attempts to carry out a revolution. The first one, in Santarém, in December 1918, was led by the republicans Francisco da Cunha Leal and Álvaro Xavier de Castro. The second one was monarchist and was perpetrated in January 1919 and organized by Paiva Couceiro, who for some time managed to control the northern part of the country in what was called the Monarchy of the North. Although Canto e Castro was a monarchist, as President of the Republic he had to fight against a movement that defended his own ideals.","country":"Portugal"}
