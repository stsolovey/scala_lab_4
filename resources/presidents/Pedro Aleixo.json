As President of the Chamber of Deputies he witnessed the coup d'état that installed the dictatorship of the Estado Novo in Brazil. Aleixo was the last vice president to hold the office of President of the Senate. As vice president, he was the designate to succeed Artur da Costa e Silva after he became incapacitated due to disease, but Aleixo was removed from the vice presidency on 6 October 1969 by the Brazilian Military Junta of 1969, which took the acting presidency instead. In 2011, pursuant to Law Nº 12.486, dated 12 September, Aleixo was included in the gallery of those who were anointed by the Brazilian Nation to the Supreme Magistracy. This means that he should be considered an ex-president, for all legal purposes.   This article about a Brazilian politician is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.","country":"Brazil"}
